# 🍚 Ricely

A full-stack personal finance app that helps users track their expenses, visualize budgets, and build healthier spending habits — all while managing an adorable red panda's rice supply.

💸 Every dollar you spend is counted as **1 rice**. Spend recklessly, and the red panda gets sad as its rice stockpile vanishes. Spend wisely, and your furry friend stays full and happy.
